# E-Commerce Application: Milestone 1

Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1! This project marks the beginning of an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

---


## Project Description
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools. Through this journey, you will learn to build an e-commerce application that demonstrates the functionalities of a complete MERN stack application, including user authentication, product management, and order handling. By leveraging JavaScript throughout, the project ensures streamlined and efficient development across both the frontend and backend.

---

## Milestone 1:
In this milestone, we will:
- Gain an understanding of the overall structure of a MERN stack project.
- Learn the foundational steps for setting up a new project repository.
- Explore the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
- Witness a live demonstration of the completed application to understand its functionality, user interface, and backend integration.

## Milestone 2 : 
We structured the project, set up the frontend and backend, and built the login page for the application.
This milestone focuses on creating the project structure, configuring tools, and starting with our first user-facing feature - the Login Page.

## Milestone 3:
In this Milestone we have setup the backend folder and initialize Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected the application to the MongoDB to store and manage the data. We created several folders and files to organize the backend code and set up the Express.js server to handle HTTP requests. And config file for environmental variables. Middleware , model , utils. Error.js for handling the specific error .db folder for connecting to the MongoDB database.

## Milestone 5:

In this project, a **SignUp Page** was developed and structured under the `components` folder for modularity and better code organization. The SignUp component was subsequently imported into the `pages` folder to streamline routing and page-level management. Finally, the component was integrated into the `App.js` file to connect it to the overall application flow. 

The SignUp page includes a user-friendly form that allows users to enter their details, such as Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password, with client-side validation implemented using `react-hook-form`. Additionally, a feature was added to upload a profile picture, allowing users to preview their image before submission. This enhances the user experience and provides a seamless interface for uploading images. The form is fully functional, and the profile picture data is managed alongside other form inputs to ensure smooth submission. This integration effectively combines functionality and user-centric design for a cohesive application experience.

# E-Commerce Application: Milestone 1

Welcome to the Follow Along Project: Milestone 1! This project marks the beginning of an exciting journey to build a full-fledged E-Commerce Application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## Project Description
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools. Through this journey, you will learn to build an e-commerce application that demonstrates the functionalities of a complete MERN stack application, including user authentication, product management, and order handling. By leveraging JavaScript throughout, the project ensures streamlined and efficient development across both the frontend and backend.
